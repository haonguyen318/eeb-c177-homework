1. (?<!\w)[Ss]\w+
2. (\w+)[.!?]
3. [^.]*.\w+
4. [^.!?;]*(struggle for existence)[^.!?;]*[.!?]
Extra Credit: ((?<=[.!?]\s)\w+)|(^\w+) 
Explanation: [.!?]\s \w+ find the word following the punctuation and whitespace
	     ?<= remove the punctuation before the first word
	     |(^\w+) find the first word in the paragraph since the first word
	             doesn't have a punctuation before it so the other code 
		     wouldn't apply to it
