Lecture Homework #1 (Week 2)

Commands for Software Carpentry Tutorial

# First make a directory for week two in the class assignments directory
cd /Directory/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/week-two

# Next download the data-shell.zip and move the data-shell to the week-two directory
mv ~/Downloads/data-shell/ /Developer/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/week-two
cd data-shell

# Follow the Software Carpentry Tutorial:
1) Step One
pwd # to go back to the data-shell directory
ls -F # see what is contain inside of the data-shell directory

2) Create a directory
mkdir thesis # create a new directory call thesis
ls -F # check to see that the new directory (thesis) is in the current working directory (data-shell)
ls -F thesis # check what is in the thesis directory. There is nothing in it yet.

3) Create a text file
cd thesis # make thesis the working directory
nano draft.txt # create a txt file using the command nano which is a text editor. Then type a few lines of text and save the file using 
	       # the command 'ctrl o' and then exit out using the command 'ctrl x'. 
ls # we can see that the draft.txt file has been created

4) Creating Files a Different Way
touch my_file.txt # create an empty file
ls -1 # inspect how large the txt file is

5) Moving files and directories
cd ~/Desktop/data-shell/ # go to data-shell directory
mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt # change the name from draft.txt to quotes.txt
ls thesis # see if the file name has been changed

mv thesis/quotes.txt # move quotes.txt from thesis into the working directory
ls thesis # check to see what is in this directory. Thesis  is now empty.
ls quotes.txt # check to see that quotes.txt is in the working directory

6) Copying files and directories
cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt # make a copy of the file
ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt # check that there are two paths as arguments
cp -r thesis thesis_backup # copy a directory and all its contents
ls thesis thesis_backup # list out the contents of the thesis and thesis_backup directories, to view multiple directories

mkdir backup # make a backup directory
cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/ # copy multiple filenames over to the backup directory

6) Removing files and directories
rm quotes.txt # remove the quotes.txt file 
ls quotes.txt # check that the file is gone

re -r thesis # remove the thesis directory recursively

re -i thesis_backup/quotations.txt # remove the file and check yes or no to confirm the removal
