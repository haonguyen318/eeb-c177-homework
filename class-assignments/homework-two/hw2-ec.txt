Homework 2 Extra Credit - Exercises 1.10.1 and 1.10.2 from textbook

1. Change directory to CSB/unix/sandbox.  

Command: cd /Developer/repos/CSB/unix/sandbox

2. What is the size of the file Marra2014_data.fasta?16  

#ls -lh display file sizes in human readable units (K, M, G for kilobytes,  megabytes, gigabytes).

Command: ls -lh ../data/Marra2014_data.fasta

#Size of file: 553K (kilobytes)

3. Create a copy of Marra2014_data.fasta in the sandbox and name it  my_file.fasta.  

# . = in the current directory so the copied file will in sandbox.

Command: cp ../data/Marra2014_data.fasta ./my_file.fasta

4. How many contigs are classified as isogroup00036?  

#grep is a command that finds all the lines of a file that match a given pattern. Adding the option -c allows the command to count the lines that contain a match.
 
Command: grep -c isogroup00036 my_file.fasta

#There are 16 contigs that classify as isogroup00036.

5. Replace the original “two-spaces” delimiter with a comma.  

#cat is a command that allows us to concatenate and print files.
#tr is a command that allows us to substitute or remove a specific character in a text file.
#tr -s allows us to "squeeze" all consecutive occurrences of what follows after the command
#the command tr cannot operate on a file in place (working file) meaning  that it cannot change a file directly. So we have to create a copy of the contents of a file for it to operate on and make changes to.

Command: cat my_file.fasta | tr -s "  " | tr " " "," > new_file.fasta

6. How many unique isogroups are in the file?  

Command: grep '>' new_file.fasta | cut -d "," -f 4 | sort | uniq | wc -l

7. Which contig has the highest number of reads (numreads)? How many  reads does it have?
